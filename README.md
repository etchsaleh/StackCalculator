# Stack Calculator
**Data Structures** Project:
- A **stack-based calculator** program that takes an _algebraic equation_ (infix notation) from the user, converts it to _reverse polish notation_ (postfix) and finally prints the output to the user.
- Calculator currently **supports** _parentheses_ as well as _multi-digit_, _floating point_ and _negative numbers_.
